Subject: Constructive Discussion on [Project Name] Direction


Hi [Team],


I wanted to address some concerns I've observed regarding [specific issue] to ensure we're all aligned as we move forward.


The Situation: [Describe objectively what happened/the disagreement]


Different Perspectives:


* [Team Member 1]'s concern: [Their view]
* [Team Member 2]'s concern: [Their view]
* [Team Member 3]'s concern: [Their view]


My Observation: All perspectives have merit. Rather than choose sides, I'd like us to find a solution that addresses everyone's concerns.


Proposed Path Forward:


1. Let's discuss this in our meeting [Date] at [Time]
2. Each person gets 5 minutes to explain their position
3. We brainstorm together on solutions
4. We make a collective decision and move forward


What I Need from Everyone:


* Come with an open mind
* Assume best intentions
* Focus on the research goal, not ego
* Be willing to compromise


I believe we can work through this and come out stronger. Our research is too important to let internal disagreements derail us.


Looking forward to resolving this together.


[Your Name]
