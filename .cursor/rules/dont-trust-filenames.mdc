# Don't Trust File Naming

File names in this project are **not reliable** indicators of what's inside.

- **Never assume** a file's purpose, exports, or behavior from its path or filename alone.
- **Always read or inspect** the actual file contents before relying on it (e.g., for imports, refactors, or documentation).
- When the user or code refers to a file, **resolve by content** (search/read) rather than by name.

Apply this when navigating the codebase, answering questions, or making changes.
