The impossible suddenly seems doable. Many of our backed students tell us: \"Getting DreamXec funding was my turning point. I stopped doubting myself and started building.\""

Seeing those 20-year-old founders execute with confidence—it reminded me why I love India's potential. Three of them reached out later for job interviews. Two are now in my team. Best ROI I've ever made."
